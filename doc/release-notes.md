Ethanexo Core version v3.2.0
==========================

Release is now available from:

  <https://github.com/exolorethan/ethanexo/releases>

This is a new hotfix release.

Please report bugs using the issue tracker at github:

  <https://github.com/exolorethan/ethanexo/issues>


Upgrading and downgrading
=========================

How to Upgrade
--------------

If you are running an older version, shut it down. Wait until it has completely
shut down (which might take a few minutes for older versions), then run the
installer (on Windows) or just copy over /Applications/Ethanexo-Qt (on Mac) or
ethanexod/ethanexo-qt (on Linux). If you upgrade after DIP0003 activation and you were
using version < 0.13 you will have to reindex (start with -reindex-chainstate
or -reindex) to make sure your wallet has all the new data synced. Upgrading
from version 0.13 should not require any additional actions.

When upgrading from a version prior to v3.1.0, the
first startup of Ethanexo Core will run a migration process which can take a few
minutes to finish. After the migration, a downgrade to an older version is only
possible with a reindex (or reindex-chainstate).

Notable changes
===============

This release adds some missing translations and help strings. It also fixes
a couple of build issues and a rare crash on some linux systems.
