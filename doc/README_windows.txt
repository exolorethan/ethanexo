==========

What is Ethanexo (ETXO)?
-------------------------

Ethanexo is a fork of the Dash codebase; which uses a combination of x11-PoW and Deterministic Masternodes to secure the cryptocurrency's network and blockchain.

The Ethanexo blockchain is further secured by Masternodes, which enforce ChainLocks and InstantSend for an extremely fast, secure network monitored by 1000s of Masternodes, constantly producing secure quorums.

The first consecutive blocks contain the coins allocated for the user coin swap (From the MUE codebase), destined for holders of the previous PoS/MN version of Ethanexo.

7.5 million (7,500,000) ETXO was reserved in the first mined block for swapping user coins.

A total of 1,000 ETXO is required to run a masternode;


Setup

Ethanexo Core is the original ETXO client and it builds the backbone of the network.
However, it downloads and stores the entire history of ETXO transactions;
depending on the speed of your computer and network connection, the synchronization
process can take anywhere from a few hours to a day or more.
